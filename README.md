# Cine_Sprite_Recommender

Developed by Pirate-Emperor, Cine_Sprite_Recommender is a machine learning model that provides movie recommendations based on user preferences. This model is trained using a dataset from IMDb, which provides extensive movie information and user ratings.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Generates movie recommendations tailored to individual user preferences and tastes.
- **IMDb Dataset**: Trained on a dataset from IMDb, including movie information, genres, and user ratings.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses collaborative filtering techniques to predict user preferences based on similar user behavior.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies similar to those the user has liked or interacted with.
- **Scalable**: Can handle large datasets and scale to accommodate more users and data.

## Prerequisites

To use the model, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.)

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pirate-Emperor/Cine_Sprite_Recommender.git
cd Cine_Sprite_Recommender
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will train the ML model using the IMDb dataset and generate movie recommendations based on user input.

## Data Source

The project uses a dataset from IMDb, which includes movie information, genres, and user ratings. The dataset can be obtained from the IMDb website or other data-sharing platforms.

## Development

To enhance the project, you can modify the Python scripts in the `src` directory. Some potential areas for improvement include:

- Incorporating additional features, such as movie directors, actors, or reviews.
- Experimenting with different ML algorithms for better recommendation accuracy.
- Implementing a user interface for an interactive experience.
- Deploying the model as a web service for easy access.
